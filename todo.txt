layers move when others send code
cursor jumps to received layer
layers are not updated sometimes
having a layer owner, otherwise there are orfan layers who no one dares to delete.
showing layer name, layer owner

Firepad needs Firebase :(

OT - operational transformations

Use codemirror. 
http://codemirror.net/

And mixing both:

Tested with 20 editors. Syncs fine.

Cursor sync'ing is missing:

Concept:
  simple: no chat, no db, no hidden stuff.

CodeMirror:
  var c = doc.getCursor('head');
  doc.setCursor(c);
  var d = doc.getValue();
  doc.setValue(d);
  events: change? changes? cursorActivity? focus? blur?


Interact: 
  eye icon: to enable, disable, 
  delete: delete key on empty field
  sort: drag and drop http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
  room: get from URL
  move in grid: ESC > arrows

Saving:
  server: on click, save snapshot [room].js to disk. max 1 per 10 sec? name? delete?
  client: load snapshot

Avoid infinite loops:
  Set timeout(50ms?)
  Eval your code (alt+enter)
  On timeout, if code evaled, send code.
  If infinite loop or slow code, code is not sent.
  Would be good to have a presentation computer (it never receives infinite loops)
