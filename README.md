* Add cursors to move around grid
  * Use ENTER to edit
  * M to move
  * SPACE to toggle layer on/off
* Show room name and participants
* Allow changing rooms (show max 10 random rooms?)
* Hide depth fields. Use GUI.
* If someone edits same cell as you, indicate changed (but don't rewrite your work without notice)
  * ESC cancels your edit
  * CTRL+ENTER sends your edit
* Show where people are editing
* Show chat in GUI

## Done

* Save layers on server to database on disk
* When entering the chat room, send all layers in that room
