# Joukkue - Collaborative Creative Coding

Work in progress.

## To do

* Show room name, your name, participants
* Allow changing rooms (show max 10 random rooms?)

* Remember which field I was editing, and the selection, so I can restore it after coming back from chat box.
* Add cursors to move around grid
  * Use ENTER to edit
  * M to move
  * SPACE to toggle layer on/off
* Hide depth fields. Use GUI.
* If someone edits same cell as you, indicate changed (but don't rewrite your work without notice)
  * ESC cancels your edit (jumps between grid and chat)
  * CTRL+ENTER sends your edit
* Show where people are editing
* Allow tempo tapping to set var for loops. also offset.
* Indicate crashed layer in grid

## Done

* Save layers on server to database on disk
* When entering the chat room, send all layers in that room
* Give automatic name to user, allow renaming
  * Create name generator
* Show chat in GUI
* Show layer crashes in chat.
* Chat, highlight on focus.
